The Answer to Product Customisation and Supply Chain Automation

Spiff Commerce delivers online and in-store merchants the ability to offer custom products whilst maintaining a low cost of production which means custom can now be affordable to consumers and profitable to the merchant. Using the Spiff Commerce 4 pillars (asset storage, product customiser, data processing and delivery automation) almost any experience can be achieved. Merchants can choose from our proven out of the box UI / UX or for more bespoke requirements you can use our API to design your own UI / UX.
